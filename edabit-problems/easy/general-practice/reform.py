# A word has been split into a left part and
# a right part. Re-form the word by adding both halves together,
# changing the first character to an uppercase letter.

# Examples:
# get_word("seas", "onal") ➞ "Seasonal"
# get_word("comp", "lete") ➞ "Complete"
# get_word("lang", "uage") ➞ "Language"


def get_word(left, right):
    word = left + right
    return word.title()
